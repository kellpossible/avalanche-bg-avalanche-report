about-description = This project is run by Bulgarian Avalanche Association, a registered non-profit NGO, which has started an avalanche forecasting service in the Republic of Bulgaria. Currently we provide free, high-quality information and warnings about avalanche conditions in the Bansko area, which is a popular location for off-piste and backcountry freeriding and ski touring. We heavily rely on the contributions of volunteers and donors, and welcome anyone who is interested to help further the project. You can contact us via email [CONTACT@AVALANCHE.BG](mailto:contact@avalanche.bg) or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/avalanchebulgaria).
    
    The website software `avalanche-report` is open source, available over at <https://github.com/kellpossible/avalanche-report>, new contributors are welcome! Feel free to contact the team there if you wish to deploy something similar for your forecast region.
